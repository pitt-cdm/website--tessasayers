For my website, I want to make it about Bryce Harper and his free agency. The baseball season is only a month
away and he still hasn’t singed. There are three main teams who have been in the deal for almost the entire time, 
the Phillies, Dodgers and Giants. There have also been rumors going around about what each team is offering and why 
Bryce won’t sign. 

I thought it would be fun to make a website to track his movements and what is happening. For the main page I envision
a menu bar either on the top or side with the options of: History, Biography, Phillies, Giants, Dodgers. Each page 
will have carefully planned text to help tell the story. 

I will have a picture of Bryce (either real or cartoonish) in the center of the page with the title “Where will Bryce
go” or “Where did Bryce go” depending on if he signed yet or not yet. I would like to map a map of the USA behind him
with San Fan, LA and Philly highlighted. Each city will have a star users can click on that will take you to the same
page, but with a different CSS code to reflect the colors of those teams. 

If he has signed, I would like to put a thumbs up or thumbs down pop up on the page as well depending what city you 
click on. 

While I know this will be difficult, it is something that interests me and I think it will be fun to create.
